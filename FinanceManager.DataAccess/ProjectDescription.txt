The repository class is responsible for data-retrieval and data-saving. 
In this implementation we save the data (which is just a dictionary) in json-format
in a file specified in a settings file.

Data-retrieval and saving is handled by the (build-in) filestream class. In order to convert
the data to a string we use the Newtonsoft-package which can serialize and deserialize objects
to and from the json-format.
